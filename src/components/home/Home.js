        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>My name is Ivan Jaimes and I am a recent Graduate from Stephen F. Austin State University with a Bachelors of Music with emphases in Sound Recording Technology. During my time in University, I was involved as Recording Crew Manager for the School of Music and Sound Engineer for the School of Theatres Voice-Over class.

        <p>Along with a love for music, I have a strong passion with computers. My love for technology started when I was around 14. My little cousin forgot his password to his computer and had no way in logging in. Having a basic knowledge of Linux, I remembered that there was a Linux Distro called Backtrack full of hacking tools. With the help of Backtrack and a lot of patience, I was able to unlock his computer by changing his password. This had me hooked and eventually led to me learning how to program.
 <br /></p>
        <p>During my senior year of college, I decided that I wanted to work with computers. So I started to focus my time learning Java and Python. Then I moved on to Web Development in which I learned HTML, CSS, Javascript, Jquery, and Bootstrap. After learning the basics of Front-End Web Development, I moved towards the backend by learning NodeJs, Express, MongoDB, and React Js.
