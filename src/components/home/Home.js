        <p>Hello!</p>
        <p>My name is Ivan Jaimes and I am a recent Graduate from Stephen F. Austin State University with a Bachelors of Music with emphases in Sound Recording Technology. During my time in University, I was involved as Recording Crew Manager for the School of Music and Sound Engineer for the School of Theatres Voice-Over class.
        <br /></p>
        <p>During my junior year of college I decided that I wanted to become a Web Developer and started to refocus my time learning Java, Python, and the Front-End stack. After learning how to develop the Front-End, I continued learning more backend frameworks such as NodeJs, Express, MongoDB, and React Js. Along the way I took Java classes in college, learning about data structures and algorithms, and read many programming books!
